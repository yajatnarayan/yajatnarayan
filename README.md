## 🚀 What I'm Building

### **Holos.io** — Software Developer (Aug 2025 - Present)
Developing Unity-based VR training software for U.S. Air Force personnel as part of a $15M defense contract
- Built real-time 3D spatial replay system using Apple Vision Pro sensor data with sub-centimeter positional accuracy
- Engineered Euclidean transformation algorithms on custom Unity mesh models for training evaluation
- Reduced design iteration cycles by 40% through user research with 15+ Air Force personnel and rapid prototyping

### **Siemens Industry** — Software Engineering Intern (Summer 2025)
Architected cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for IoT data processing
- Built decoupled CI/CD pipeline processing 100K+ daily data points using GoLang, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB
- Increased data processing throughput by 35% with asynchronous workers and optimized batch operations
- Reduced production downtime by 45% through automated validation and health monitoring systems

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [UnoPass - Local-First Password Manager](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/unopass)
> Production-grade password vault with military-grade encryption, browser autofill, and zero-plaintext storage

**Tech:** TypeScript, Node.js, React, Chrome Extension API, AES-256-GCM  
**Security Features:**
- OWASP-compliant encryption with scrypt KDF (65,536 iterations) and HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification
- Rate limiting (5 attempts/15min), auto-lock sessions, cryptographically secure password generation
- Atomic file operations with zero-plaintext storage—vault data only decrypts in memory during active sessions
- Comprehensive test coverage for encryption, validation, rate limiting, and domain matching

**Impact:** Built as an educational MVP demonstrating secure password management principles inspired by 1Password

### 🧠 [Handwritten Digit Recognition from Scratch](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/digit-recognition)
> Full-stack OCR application with custom neural network—no ML frameworks

**Tech:** Python, NumPy, Flask, JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas  
**Implementation:**
- Multi-layer perceptron built from first principles using only NumPy (no TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Custom backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions demonstrating deep understanding of neural network mathematics
- Interactive web interface with real-time digit drawing, preprocessing user input into 400-dimensional feature vectors
- Flask RESTful API supporting dual-mode functionality: model training with labeled samples and real-time prediction

**Impact:** Demonstrates ML fundamentals and full-stack integration without relying on high-level frameworks

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I focus on building systems that solve real problems with measurable impact. Whether it's reducing military training risk through VR simulations, securing user credentials with production-grade cryptography, or optimizing data pipelines to handle 100K+ daily operations, I prioritize:

- **Security-first architecture** — OWASP compliance, threat modeling, defense-in-depth
- **Measurable outcomes** — Quantified improvements in efficiency, reliability, and user experience
- **Production quality** — Comprehensive testing, atomic operations, proper error handling

Currently exploring: Spatial computing, real-time distributed systems, and infrastructure automation.
