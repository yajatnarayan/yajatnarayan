# GitHub Profile Setup Guide

## 1. Profile Bio (160 characters max)

**Recommended:**
```
CS @ UW-Madison | SWE @ Holos.io | VR • Cloud • Deep Learning | Python, GoLang, React | AWS Certified
```

**Alternative (impact-focused):**
```
Building VR training systems for the Air Force. Ex-Siemens. Python • GoLang • AWS • Unity
```

## 2. Create Profile README Repository

**Steps:**
1. Create a new repo named exactly: `yajatnarayan` (your GitHub username)
2. Make it public
3. Upload the `README.md` file from this directory
4. GitHub will automatically display it on your profile

## 3. Profile Settings to Fill

**Location:** Madison, WI (or "Remote" if preferred)

**Company:** Your current startup/role or leave blank

**Website:** Your portfolio URL

**Social accounts:**
- Add LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yajatnarayan
- Add personal site if you have one

**Status (optional):**
- 🎯 Building [project name]
- 🚀 Shipping daily
- 💻 Open to interesting problems

## 4. Pinned Repositories

Based on your resume, here are suggested repos to pin and their descriptions:

### Your Projects (create these if not already on GitHub):

**1. lenet5-scene-recognition**
```
Custom LeNet-5 CNN for scene recognition trained on 120K images. Achieved 25.7% accuracy improvement through hyperparameter tuning. Built with PyTorch.
```

**2. password-security-system**
```
Argon2-based password encryption with real-time breach detection via API integration. Reduced vulnerability by 80% in simulated attacks. Python.
```

**3. moon-bar-website** (if allowed to share)
```
Interactive business website with analytics and SEO optimization. Driving $50K+ monthly sales through improved UX. JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
```

**4. aws-cicd-pipeline** (Siemens work - if shareable or recreated)
```
Decoupled CI/CD pipeline handling 100K+ data points from AWS and DynamoDB. 35% efficiency gain, 45% downtime reduction. GoLang.
```

**5. greeky-platform** (if available)
```
Responsive React app with Docker deployment and CI/CD. Optimized load times by 40%, generated $2K revenue in first month.
```

**6. Additional project ideas to showcase:**
- VR training demo (Unity/Swift) if you can share non-sensitive work
- Data structures/algorithms implementations
- Any open-source contributions
- Personal projects (tools, automation scripts, experiments)

## 5. README Tips

**Current README style:**
- Clean, scannable sections
- Tech stack grouped logically
- Shows personality without being try-hard
- Action-oriented ("building," "exploring")

**If you want to customize:**
- Add a current project highlight at the top
- Include a "Recent work" section with 2-3 bullet points
- Add badges only if they're meaningful (not just decoration)
- Keep it under 30 lines total

## 6. Profile Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Profile picture uploaded (professional or personal)
- [ ] Bio written (shows expertise + personality)
- [ ] Location added
- [ ] At least one social link added
- [ ] Profile README repo created
- [ ] 4-6 repos pinned with clear descriptions
- [ ] Recent commit activity (you already have this ✓)
- [ ] Contribution graph visible (check privacy settings)

## 7. Quick Wins

**Immediate credibility boosters:**
1. Green contribution squares (regular commits)
2. Well-documented pinned projects
3. Clear, specific profile bio
4. Professional consistency (bio → README → repo descriptions)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use generic descriptions ("My awesome project")
- Don't pin private repos
- Don't overcomplicate the README (no ASCII art, excessive badges)
- Don't leave profile fields blank

## 8. Profile Appeal Strategy

**For recruiters:**
- Lead with tech stack in bio
- Pin production-ready projects
- Show clean, tested code
- Include work that shipped to users

**For founders/startups:**
- Emphasize building and shipping
- Show side projects and experiments
- Demonstrate learning velocity
- Include collaborative or open-source work

**Your current vibe:** Balanced between both—technical depth + builder mentality
